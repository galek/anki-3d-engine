1) Building

  For build info see build/README


2) Assets
  
  Currently there are no assets (models, textures, materials etc) so even if
  you build it, the application will fail to run
  
  
3) Submitting patches

  If you want to update/patch the file README (this file), for example, do:

  make changes to README
	
  $ svn diff README > /tmp/foo

  E-mail the "foo" file with subject "[PATCH] README updates"

The controllers are part of the scene node objects. The control the node's behaviour. 

They have an input (script, animation, etc) and they control a scene node. The naming convention of the controllers is:

<what the controller controls>_<the input of the contoller>_ctrl_t

For Example:

script_trf_ctrl_t
path_trf_ctrl_t
anim_skel_ctrl_t
skel_mesh_ctrl_t
script_light_ctrl_t

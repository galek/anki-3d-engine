There are 4 build targets in this folder. There is also a build system that generates GNU makefiles. If you want to generate the makefile for the debug target (for example) do the following:

cd <path to anki>/build/debug
../genmakefile.py

This will generate a "Makefile". To build just type:

make

And the build will will begin. 

Sometimes I forget to to update all the targets. The debug is allways updated though.

The gen.cfg.py files contain the build options of every target. Their format is pretty straightforward and minimal.

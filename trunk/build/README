AnKi build system is very Linux specific (GNU make only) at the moment. It
also requires a few extra development libraries. You can also find a custom
build system that generates GNU makefiles.


1) Required libraries

	AnKi requires a few up to date versions of some libraries. The libraries are:
	- Bullet Physics
	- SDL ver 1.3
	- GLEW

	So before generating makefiles or building AnKi you have to download from
	their repositories and build the above libraries. Instructions follow. You can
	alternately use the script download-and-build-externals.sh
	

1.1) Bullet Physics Library

	From now on the AnKi requires the Bullet physics library. You need CMake and
	SVN installed.

	1) Go to the root AnKi path (where src, shaders and blenderscripts are)
	2) cd ..
	3) svn checkout http://bullet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bullet_svn
	4) cd bullet_svn
	5) cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	6) make


1.2) SDL ver 1.3

	We need SDL ver 1.3 for creating OpenGL 3.x context. You need to have the
	Mercurial and autoconf installed.

	1) Go to the root AnKi path (where src, shaders and blenderscripts are)
	2) cd ..
	3) hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL SDL-hg
	4) cd SDL-hg
	5) ./autogen.sh
	6) ./configure
	7) make
	

1.3) GLEW

	The latest GLEW provides us with OpenGL 3 and 4 extensions. Needs SVN and a 
	Unix environment (for step 5).
	
	1) Go to the root AnKi path (where src, shaders and blenderscripts are)
	2) cd ..
	3) svn co https://glew.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/glew/trunk/glew glew
	4) cd glew
	5) make extensions
	6) make


2) Generating makefiles and building AnKi

	There are 4 build targets in this folder. There is also a build system that
	generates GNU makefiles (it requires Python 3 installed). If you want to 
	generate the makefile for the debug target (for example) do the following:

	1) cd <path to anki>/build/debug
	2) ../genmakefile.py
	
	Now there is an updated "Makefile". To build just type:
	
	3) make

	And the build process will begin. 

	The gen.cfg.py files contain the build options of every target. Their format
	is pretty straightforward and minimal.

	WARNING: Sometimes I forget to update all the targets. The debug is always
	updated though.
